If they are equal then you should print on the Console “true” otherwise you should print “false” on the console. You should take input from the user in the main function and then pass that to your function.
10-Task2(CP): Create a function that changes true to false and false to true. Your function should take input as a string and print false if the input is true. And it should print true if the input is false. You should take input from the user in the main function and then pass that to your function.
11-Task3(CP): Suppose an Airline Company is giving discounts on the following bases:(Pakistan 5%, Ireland 10%, India 20%, England 30%, Canada 45%). Write a function that takes the country’s name, the ticket price in dollars, and then displays the final price of the ticket after the discount. You should take input from the user and then pass it to your function.
12-Extended Question: Now make this program(11-Task3(CP)) run continuously . i.e. it should take input from multiple customers until closed forcefully.
13-Task4(CP): Write a challan issuing program to tell if the car was speeding or not. If the speed is greater than 100 km/h then the car will be challenged, otherwise, the car is following the speed limit. You have to take input speed from the user and then pass it to your function named checkSpeed(int speed) and your function should do all the calculations.
14-Task5(CP): In a board game, a piece may advance 1-6 tiles forward depending on the number rolled on a six-sided die. If you advance your piece onto the same tile as another player's piece, both of you earn a bonus. Can you reach your friend's tile number in the next roll? Create a function that takes your position a and your friend's position b and prints a string “true” or “false” of whether it's possible to earn a bonus on any die roll or not.
15-Task6(CP):Create a function that takes two values: ● h hours ● m minutes. Print the value that's the longest duration. You have to take the value of hour and minute from the user
16-Task7(CP): A Flower shop offers three types of flowers. Red Rose, White Rose, and Tulips. (Red Rose=2.00 dollars/pc), (White Rose=4.10 dollars/pc), (Tulip=2.50 dollars/pc). Write a program that takes the number of red roses, white roses, tulips as input from the user, then passes them to a function named flowerShop(int redRose, int whiteRose, int tulip) and the function then calculates the total price of the flowers. If the price is greater than 200$, it gives a 20% discount on the total price and prints the original price and the total payable amount after the discount on the screen.
17-Task8(CP): Tom Cat likes to sleep all day, but his owner always plays with him whenever he has free time. To sleep well, the norm of games that Tom has is 30,000 minutes per year. The time for games he has depends on the holidays that his owner has.(Working Days=63 Minutes per day), (Holidays 127 Minutes per day). Write a program that reads the number of holidays and passes it to the function named pet(int holidays) and the function then prints whether Tom can sleep well and how much the difference from the current year’s norm. It is assumed that there are 365 days in one year.
18-Task9(CP): In COVID you have to stay home for 14 days at any given time. Do you have enough Tissue Papers to make it through? Although the number of squares per roll of TP varies significantly, we'll assume each roll has 500 sheets, and the average person uses 57 sheets per day. Create a function that will receive two parameters: ● people — Number of people in the household. ● tp — Number of rolls. print a statement telling the user if they need to buy more TP!
